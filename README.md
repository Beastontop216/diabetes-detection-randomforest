# Diabetes Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It involves data preprocessing, model training with a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## Features
- Handles missing values using mean imputation
- Applies feature standardization for improved performance
- Uses Random Forest Classifier for binary classification
- Evaluates model performance with multiple metrics
- Predicts diabetes status for new patients based on medical input

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes medical data such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## Performance
- **Accuracy**: 80%
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.81
- **Confusion Matrix**: 89 TN, 34 TP, 10 FP, 21 FN

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `random_forest.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to see data processing, training, evaluation, and prediction
